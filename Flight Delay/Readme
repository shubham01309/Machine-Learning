This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that predicts flight delays.

## Project Overview ##

This project aims to classify flights as either delayed or not delayed using a decision tree and an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). It includes steps for training models, evaluating performance, and explaining model predictions.
